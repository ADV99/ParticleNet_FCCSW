# Preparation of dataset
## Generated samples
The samples used are stored in the directory `/eos/experiment/fcc/ee/generation/DelphesEvents/pre_fall2022_training/IDEA/` .
The events were simulated using Delphes. 
The processes considered are $e^+ e^- \to Z(\to \nu \nu) H(\to aa)$ with $a = u,d,b,c,s,g$ .
Beamspot of 20 um size on Y-axis and 600 um on Z-axis was set.
Five classes are considered: $\{\}$

# Intro: Training ParticleNet in FCCSW
This repository contains the codes developed to perform the training of ParticleNet inside FCCSW and aims to furnish an example of how to set up the training.
We can identify in the complete process of training ParticleNet four main stages:
1. generation of events;
2. preparation of the dataset;
3. training;
4. evaluation.

Here we skip the first step, assuming the samples have already been generated and are available.
The second step is performed and explained inside `FCCAnalyses/` . 

We observe that the codes presented here will be subject to developements as our work continues.

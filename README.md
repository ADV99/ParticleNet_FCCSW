# Intro: Training ParticleNet in FCCSW
The contents of this repository aim to furnish an example of how to set the training of ParticleNet inside the FCCSW framework.
We can identify in the complete process of training ParticleNet four main stages:
1. generation of events;
2. preparation of dataset;
3. training;
4. evaluation.

Here skip the first step, assuming the samples have already been generated and are available.
The second step is performed and explained inside `FCCAnalyses/` . 

We observe that the codes presented here will be subject to variations as our work goes on.
